# Magento Bootstrap Marketplace Extension

This extension is a bootstrap for building a marketplace based on Magento. 

## Features

vendor features include:

* Manage Products
* Check Orders
* Simple Dashboard

## Installation
* Modman
```bash
modgit add marketplace git@github.com:thiagolima-bm/Magento_Marketplace.git 
```
* Downloading

## Configuration

This extension works like plug and play. The only that you need to do is create a store account (the vendor who will sell items on the marketplace). 
The flow is pretty much similar than the regular magento flow for creating a product and check orders.
On the vender menu, there are three items

* Dashboard - Where he will see a few reports
* Products - Where he can manage its own products
* Orders - Where he can check the its own orders
